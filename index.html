        <p>Heavenly Father, my Lord and Savior Jesus and Blessed Holy Spirit; Thank You for allowing me at this moment to enter, and remain in, a greater understanding and awareness of Your Glorious, Glorious Presence.

Lord Jesus, I thank you that because of Your crucifixion, I'm enabled to take up my cross, which in my understanding means I can reckon (count on) and act upon the fact that my old self is already dead, co-crucified with You. Any work You have remaining for me in this world can now be accomplished by You, through me, with the new me as one of Your multitude, a member of Your army of living, breathing, moving tabernacles.

Heavenly Father, in spite of my sinful deeds I claim only, only, because of the Blood Covering, that I have a right like Moses and Isaiah to live in an ever growing awareness of Your Holy, (temporally),  Holy, (heavenly awareness) 3 times transcendently Holy Presence ( that holiness which I'll never fully understand);  LEARNING every single day how to please You more and more.


Holy Spirit, I pray that you will continue to crowd out and drown out the remaining patterns myself with yourself which then allows Your fruit to ripen and effervese from my life to a sin parched and thirsty world. Fruit specifically such as  Love vs selfishness, Joy vs happiness, Peace vs anxiety and conflict, Patience vs frustration, Kindness vs anger and meanness, Goodness vs evil intentions, Faithfulness vs faithlessness Gentleness vs aggressiveness and Your control Holy Spirit vs my old patterns being in control  And all of these fruits in ever increasing measure.

Because it's when I rest and trust in Your control Holy Spirit that I get moved beyond the results of redirection. I cannot be pushed, prodded, positioned, punished or in any other way pressured or guilt-ed to be in Your presence. It's when I rest and trust in Your control Holy Spirit that I get moved beyond the results of reformation because these stinking, stubborn old patterns of mine are simply not reformable. No it's when I rest and trust in Your control Holy Spirit that I'm moved into transformation of my self-centered mind, will, emotions and personality.

Lord Jesus, Savior of this fallen world, I now bow this physical body of mine before You; and yes that does include it's earthly appetites, desires and defects. However I bow it before You in worship anyway especially in light of the fact that You bowed Your body and it still bears the marks intended for me as my just punishment.

Holy Spirit, Sanctifier and Guide of the people of God, I gratefully resubmit my mind, will, emotions and personality. But Holy Spirit, those are just concepts. More specifically intimately and personally I again surrender my thoughts, my desires, my feelings and how I interact with people to You this moment as an act of worship. In essence Holy Spirit I offer You all of me as an act of worship. 

Heavenly Father, I acknowledge You as the Designer, Creator, Sustainer and Ruler of this vast, vast 13.8 billion light year wide universe. Accordingly I prostrate my all spiritually in absolute reverent worship before Your Splendor, Majesty and Magnificence.

I ascribe and direct all my praise, all my worship, all Glory and all honor in the universe longing for every iota of it to be returned to You Father, and to Your Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Thank you Blessed, Devine and Glorious Three in One, I so need and depend upon Your mercy directed toward me.

I ask in the only Name possible,  YESHUA my HaMashiach and in Your name only Jesus do I thank you. 
( Rev 1.1.26)
